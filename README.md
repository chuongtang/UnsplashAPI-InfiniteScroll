# UnsplashAPI-InfiniteScroll
This *mobile responsive* project fetches photos from **Unsplash API** and auto-loading when scroll to 'trigger point'

The goal of this project is to apply the **infinite scroll** functionality. This is something that happens on social media as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page. Another network request is made, but it happens before you reach the bottom.
it feels like you're seamlessly scrolling forever.

The beautiful images :+1: are photos fetched from the UN-Flash API, @ https://unsplash.com
